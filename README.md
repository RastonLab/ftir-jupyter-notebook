## functions.py

`functions.py` was the initial program used with the Radis library. The primary purpose was to generate a spectrum using `calc_spectrum` and then using custom functions from Dr. Raston to modify the spectrum depending on different temperatures and windows.

## Breakdown-of-Process-Spectrum.ipynb

Used to present the custom functions that were translated from Mathematica to Python to Dr. Raston. The Jupyter Notebook allows a dynamic enjoinment for visually displaying Python code and output with generated graphs.
